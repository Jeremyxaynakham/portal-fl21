        <p> 
           Hello, my name is Jeremy Xaynakham and welcome to my site. By the time you leave here you'll get to learn a little about me.
        </p>
        <p>
           I am currently enrolled in the Year Up program taking classes at Seattle Central College.
           Year upâ€™s mission is to close the opportunity divide by ensuring that young adults like myself gain the skills and experience 
           needed to reach their career goals or a higher education. I am in the application development track working towards earning my certification. 
           In my free time I enjoy hiking, building computers and self-development. 
        </p>
        <p>
           I have six years of experience working in customer service. In my previous positions, I have been recognized for my passion for helping others 
           and always having a positive attitude. I am determined to get the job done while also delivering quality work.
        </p>
        <p> 
           My classes combined with my passion for helping others, and always continuing to learn 
           has molded me into an emerging professional. My goal after completing Year Up is to become 
           a Data Analyst Specialist and to take the necessary courses or any other certifications needed 
           to attain a job in tech. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Thank you for visiting my site and I look forward to connecting with you on LinkedIn or you can email me at jeremyxaynakham@gmail.com 
        </p>
